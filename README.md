This project was designed so that I could get the hang of many-to-many relationships
in Ruby. CSS and general functionality was of no concern (as clear by the lack of
validation, error-checking, testing etc). I used a has-many-through table and also used
scopes for the first time. I also used custom foreign keys and sourcing to develop
more complex relationships.
